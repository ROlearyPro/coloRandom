# coloRandom

### Abstract:
[//]: <> This project presents a web-based platform that generates unique color palettes, empowering users to customize  harmonious color combinations. Inspired by popular platforms like Coolors, our site offers an interactive experience where users are presented with a selection of randomized colors. Users can browse, save, and "lock" their perferred colors, ensuring they are retained in subsequesnt palette generations. This innovative tool is a resource for designers, artists or anyone seeking a platform for creating dynamic palette generation. 

### üîç Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

###  Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This project entailed the rapid development of a GitHub project from start to completion within a five day deadline. In the fourth week of the program, this assignment challenged us to integrate our skills learned thus far to design, develop and deploy a fully functional GitHub project.

###  Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Our team of four embarked on a comprehensive group project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to develop a dynamic web application. Beyond the technical aspects, our team effectively utilized essential collagoration skills, including communication, planning and adherence to a structured Git and GitHub workflow. This project showcased our ability to work cohesively, manage tasks efficiently, and deliver a high-quality web-page within a constrained timeframe.
